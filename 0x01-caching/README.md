## Caching


This directory contains various caching algorithm implementations in Python, including:

- **BasicCache**: Unlimited cache using a dictionary.
- **FIFOCache**: First-In First-Out eviction policy.
- **LIFOCache**: Last-In First-Out eviction policy.
- **LRUCache**: Least Recently Used eviction policy.
- **MRUCache**: Most Recently Used eviction policy.
- **LFUCache**: Least Frequently Used eviction policy.

All classes inherit from `BaseCaching` and follow the requirements for documentation, style, and usage.
